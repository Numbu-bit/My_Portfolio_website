    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Mubarik Yussif, I’m a Computer Science student passionate about building solutions that bridge technology and real-world challenges. My interests span software development, algorithms,AI/ML and innovative problem-solving.

    Alongside my studies, I served as a Technical Coach for the Ghana Science and Technology Explorer Prize (GSTEP), where I mentored student teams in applying technology to design creative solutions. This experience strengthened my leadership, collaboration, and technical mentoring skills.

    Outside academics, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and continuously learning through hands-on experience.</p>
